$ HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION

The votes polled by voters are encrypted and using homomorphic encryption technique without idea of plain data directly computation is performed on encrypted data and results are declared with plain output data by decryption. So, the voting privacy is protected and its an efficient way to eradicate many problems with general voting. We can even reach remote locations with e-voting. People can cast their vote from any place in globe over the internet. People can open the authorized website and can easily cast their vote to their candidate at any place and anytime they want.

For those who dont know homomorphic encrytpion you can understand from below definition.

Homomorphic encryption:-

Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext. The purpose of homomorphic encryption is to allow computation on encrypted data.
